#### 3. Test Design
  
  *	Testing the physics collision with the character and a block (square / rectangle)
  *	Testing the change of gravity
  *	Testing the change of gravity with 2 players (shouldn’t affect the other player)
  *	Testing completing a level
  *	Testing the two losing situations (runs into an object and stays behind and fall off the world)
  *	Testing change the gravity while at mid-air
